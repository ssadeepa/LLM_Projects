However, we all know that this is never quite the case, no matter how much we try, we cannot break free from the past.\\\" Read more: David Bowie returns with new single, album . In that sense it's an unbeatable image. Bowie's glittering reputation rests on his determination, during his extraordinary run of albums in the 1970s, to escape the past and embrace the future, but he was also clever enough to realize that there's no such thing as an entirely blank slate, and that tension was the motor of his genius. The excitement surrounding his surprise comeback, after a decade of supposed retirement, reminds us that he is rock's unrivalled innovator-in-chief. His early reinventions could perhaps be explained by sheer ambition. That's why David Jones from suburban Bromley, on the southern outskirts of London, became David Bowie (rhymes with Zoe, not Maui) and then Bowie, fearing that 1969's \\\"Space Oddity\\\" would render him a one-hit wonder, became Ziggy Stardust, the first post-modern rock star. If fame was all he was looking for, he would have been happy with that, but his hunger for change exceeded his appetite for success. He killed off Ziggy after just 18 months and unveiled a series of new identities, each with its own sound. Photos: David Bowie's ever-changing look . To listen to all of Bowie's 70s albums in sequence is still a dizzying experience, because each one attempts to eclipse its predecessor. On \\\"Aladdin Sane\\\" he explored the relationship between showbusiness and mental illness. \\\"Diamond Dogs\\\" was an apocalyptic vision which spun the mid-70s' darkest fears into a kind of glam-rock opera. The \\\"plastic soul\\\" of \\\"Young Americans\\\" was his strange response to the sound of black America and \\\"Station to Station,\\\" recorded in cocaine-maddened seclusion in Los Angeles in the guise of the \\\"Thin White Duke,\\\" presaged his return to Europe. Remarkably, these page-turning albums emerged at the rate of around one a year. The only possible comparison in terms of creative momentum is the Beatles, and there were four of them. Beyond the records themselves, Bowie's restless eye for new stimuli, drawn from the worlds of cinema, theatre, fashion and visual art, made him pop's most imaginative stylist. London's V&A museum is mounting a major retrospective of his visual work this spring -- rare honor for a pop star. Read more: Bowie back after the bonds . As the artwork of \\\"he Next Day\\\" and the lyrics of comeback single \\\"Where Are We Now?\\\" suggest, Bowie's mystique resides most powerfully in the three albums he recorded in Berlin in the late 70s: \\\"Low,\\\" \\\"Heroes\\\" and \\\"Lodger.\\\" Of all his rebirths this was the most radical, influential and multi-faceted. The Berlin albums are perfectly poised between art and pop, containing both avant-garde enigmas like \\\"Warszawa\\\" and glorious, gripping songs like the title track of \\\"Heroes,\\\" which sounded not at all out of place, 35 years later, as Team GB's Olympic anthem. Brian Eno, who worked on Bowie's Berlin trilogy, once compared rock music to a blank sheet of paper that was rapidly filled in and Bowie did more than anyone in the 70s to colonize that white space. Each record was, to quote one song title, a fantastic voyage, alerting other musicians to new possibilities and charting a path for entire scenes. It's impossible to imagine the landscape of early 80s pop, for example, without Bowie's influence, and you can detect his DNA in countless artists, from Pet Shop Boys to Lady Gaga, U2 to Blur, Joy Division to Nine Inch Nails, Franz Ferdinand to LCD Soundsystem. To any musician who worries about reconciling artistic integrity with commercial success, or sonic innovation with emotional truth, Bowie's 70s work is proof that, with enough talent and judgement, you can have it all. Of course records this good cast a long shadow and, to paraphrase Barnbrook, no matter how much he tried, Bowie couldn't break free from the past. While his bad albums in subsequent decades were justly criticized, his good ones were unfairly underrated. Although he remained curious, enthusiastic and eager to take risks right up to 2003's \\\"Reality,\\\" he was punished for no longer reinventing the wheel with each release. As long as Bowie was still recording regularly, all but his most devoted fans took him for granted. They won't be making that mistake again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dorian Lynskey.\",\n          \"By . Lizzie Parry . Are you consumed by a fear of dirt and germs, obsessed with washing your hands? Do you repeat certain actions a set number of times or worry that your home may be burgled or ravaged by fire? If so, you could be among one of the millions of people worldwide battling Obessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). OCD is a chronic mental health condition associated with obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviour. A sufferer is compelled to carry out repetitive actions or mental acts. To take the OCD test click below . Often they feel they need to carry out their compulsion in order to prevent their obessession from becoming true. For a sufferer obsessed with a fear of being burgled, they may feel compelled to check and re-check the locks on their doors and windows multiple times before being able to leave the house. It is one of the most common mental health disorders, affecting between 1 and 2 per cent of the population, according to the charity OCD Action. A test used by the Channel 4 show Embarrssing Bodies asks how you would react to a set of circumstances. It was developed by Dr Wayne Goodman of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. It features 25 key questions to give an insight as to whether a person is at risk of developing the condition. Examples include: 'Are you over concerned with keeping objects (such as clothing, shopping, tools) in a perfect order, or arranged exactly?' and 'Do you repeat routine actions a certain number of times or until it just feels right?' So far . 83,327 people have taken the OCD test, with 28 per cent of men scoring . in the highest at risk category and 36 per cent of women found to be in . the highest at risk category. People living in northern England and Northern Ireland show the highest incidence of OCD. Those . in the 18 to 30 age bracket were at the highest risk of suffering OCD, . with those aged between 56 and 60 found to be at lowest risk. People . working in the food, drinks and retail sectors were more prone to the . condition, while IT workers were least likely to suffer OCD. A test to establish whether you are at risk of developing OCD will be discussed on the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies. So far of the 83,327 people who have taken the test, 28 per cent of men and 36 per cent of women scored in the highest risk category, while those living in northern England and Northern Ireland were shown to be most likely to suffer the condition. Those aged between 18 and 30 are most at risk of OCD, while people in the 56-60 age group are less likely to suffer the condition . The 25-question quiz asks people how they would react to a series of circumstances to establish whether they are at risk of developing OCD . OCD is categtorised by four stages, obsession, anxiety, compulsion and temporary relief. A . sufferer will become overwhelmed by a constant obsessive fear or . concern, such as the possibility they will contract a serious illness . through contact with germs. Their . thoughts will develop into an anxiety and intense stress causing them . to develop a pattern of compulsive behaviour in order to reduce anxiety. That behaviour will inspire temporary relief from the anxiety but the obsession and anxiety will return, and the cycle begins again. A form of psychotherapy, known as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), can be successful in treating OCD. With the right treatment, OCD can be managed very effectively with a likely reduction in the severity of the symptoms, helping achieve a good quality of life. In some cases, treatment can lead to a total cure. The results of the tests will be discussed on tonight's episode of Embarrassing Bodies, on Channel 4 at 8pm. The test assesses how much time a person spends each day consumed by their obsession, and how hard it is for you to control the compulsion. The results of the test are set to be discussed live on the Channel 4 show Embarrassing Bodies .\",\n          \"Mashudur Choudhury, the first Briton to be prosecuted for joining ISIS, has today been jailed for four years for preparing acts of terrorism . A youth club leader who was described as 'living a Walter Mitty lifestyle' and is the first Briton to be prosecuted for travelling to Syria to join ISIS has been jailed for four years. Father-of-two Mashudur Choudhury, 31, is the only one of a group of six young men from Portsmouth to have returned after joining the brutal terror group. All but one of those who stayed has since been killed in the fighting - but Choudhury was apparently sent back after failing the selection process. Sentencing him at Kingston Crown Court, Judge Paul Dodgson said Choudhury had encouraged a large number of other young men to follow in his footsteps. Speaking at Kingston Crown Court in South West London, the judge said: 'Whatever the motivation, anybody who prepares to fight for a political or ideological cause in another country must be in no doubt that they commit a serious offence. 'I have no doubt that when you embarked on this trip you and your companions hoped that your actions would encourage others to take the same journey. 'That has indeed occurred with the disastrous consequences we, and so many young men's families, now live with.' The judge said that Choudhury had been 'living a lie' having cultivated an image of himself as a 'teacher or scholar' and projected an image to the younger members of the group of 'being some sort of elder who could advise and guide them.' Scroll down for video . 'I believe in your imagination you saw yourself as some sort of leader and potential hero,' the judge said, before adding that when Choudhury got to the camp 'you were either deemed unsuitable or that when your fantasises collided with the harsh realities of the fighting in Syria, you lost the will to remain there.' The judge said that while Choudhury was not the leader of the group, 'There is no doubt in my mind that you, as the older man, encouraged them to remain committed to their plan and in due course you were even suggesting routes for them.' Mashudur Choudhury (circled left)  pictured at Gatwick airport before his journey to Syria in October 2013 . He said that Choudhury even had an 'absurd' plan to move his wife and two young children to Syria, but his wife thought it was 'barmy'. The Muslim community in Portsmouth blamed Choudhury, a father of two young children who ran a local youth group, for encouraging the others to leave and alerted the police. Choudhury was arrested when he returned to Gatwick after 18 days abroad in October last year and at first claimed he had been doing aid work. When he eventually admitted that he had met fighters, he said he was made to do the cooking and washing and had to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to children. But during the trial even his own barrister said he was 'soaked in lies' as it emerged  that he had been living a Walter Mitty lifestyle. He had lied to his wife about having cancer, borrowed more than \\u00a335,000 from relatives for treatment and spent the money on prostitutes and foreign holidays. He was found guilty in May of preparing acts of terrorism but there was a delay in sentencing pending a decision on another case from the Court of Appeal. During the two-week trial at Kingston Crown Court jurors heard that Choudhury travelled to Syria (pictured) on October 8 last year with a group of younger men from their home town of Portsmouth . On October 8 last year, Choudhury's friend, Hamidur Rahman, a worker in Primark in Portsmouth, made a booking for himself and four others to fly from London Gatwick to Antalya, Turkey. CCTV at Fratton Station in Portsmouth showed Rahman along with Mamunur Roshid and Assad Uzzaman boarding a train at 4.34am. Choudhury set off by car to secretly join them at Gatwick airport where they checked into flight TCX1712 along with a fifth man, Mehdi Hassan, who had arrived by train separately. They were heading to Syria to meet up with Ifitkhar Jaman, who had become something of a social media celebrity after Tweeting about the 'five star jihad' and appearing on BBC Newsnight. Jaman was the first of the group to be killed in fighting in December last year. Hamidur was killed in August, and Roshid and Hassan were killed in a US airstrike on Kobane in October, leaving only Uzzaman alive. It not believed any of them died fighting the forces of the Assad regime. Choudhury lied to his family and told them he had cancer - and then spent the money they gave him for treatment on holidays abroad and prostitutes . Choudhury had proposed calling the group the 'Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys' \\u2013 until one of them pointed out the title was too long. Their departure prompted anger at Choudhury from his local mosque and an anonymous letter was sent to Hampshire police, sources say. In Portsmouth, Choudhury ran the Muslim Youth Project and worked as a racial awareness officer for the city council where he was asked to run part of the local Prevent programme to counter violent extremism. He lasted less than two years in the job and then gave it up to buy a caf\\u00e9 near his local mosque in Portsmouth, borrowing \\u00a317,000 from his wife's sister, but the business failed. Despite his financial difficulties Choudhury bought a \\u00a317,000 Audi A6 on hire purchase and made three trips to Marrakesh in Morocco with friends, telling his wife he was on a business trip. He set himself up as a 'life coach' claiming he had 'trained and coached Muslim and non-Muslim professionals on personal development' and giving false examples of his work. As part of the pretence, he set up a company called UnlimitedU Success Limited and wrote a blog explaining how Islam had helped him overcome cancer. He also used Twitter to encourage young Muslims to move to a Muslim country and fight jihad. His activity even involved setting up a false Twitter account so that he could re-Tweet messages that backed his views. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, said Choudhury was 'leaving the shame of the life he had behind him to fight and become a martyr and make something of himself.' Police were able to access Choudary's Twitter and WhatsApp internet messages which exposed his wife's annoyance at his desire to go and fight abroad. In one message his wife told him: 'Your treatment of me, I just want to die. I hate your attitude. May you die. I hate you\\u2026You want to die in battlefield, go die. I really mean it, just go. I'll be relieved at last.' In May 2010, Choudhury's wife, who worked for Portsmouth City Council as a tenancy support officer, came home from work to find him lying in bed. 'She came upstairs and pulled the duvet off and I had been emotional at the time, I had been crying, at that time, I don't know what came into my head, but I told my wife I was diagnosed with cancer.' His wife's mother had died a few days earlier from cancer. Choudhury (circled)\\u00a0used Twitter to encourage young Muslims to move to a Muslim country and fight jihad . Muhammad Hamidur Rahman (pictured left) \\u00a0and Ifthekar Jaman (right) both from Portsmouth, were part of Choudhury's group who travelled to Syria in October last year to fight for ISIS - both died in the fighting . 'She burst into tears. I tried to calm her down and say, 'I'm fine, nothing's going to happen, I'm taking treatment,' he said. He had heard about a treatment in Singapore and added: 'I told my wife I wanted to go to Singapore. I just had a lot of pressure building up inside of me and I wanted to get away, I felt a failure in regards to the business.' Choudhury borrowed \\u00a38,000 from his wife's sister and another \\u00a327,000 from his own family and friends to pay for three trips to Singapore, texting back home with updates about fake operations. In Singapore, he claimed he went to a hospital for an appointment but never returned for tests and spent most of his time in Starbucks. When he arrived back in Britain, he told his wife he had an 'internal operation, one that wouldn't leave a scar.' He posed as a businessman called Ali Montana in Singapore and spent hundreds of pounds seeking 'female company.' On his return to Portsmouth he sent a series of explicit emails to an escort agency 'arranging sexual services,' Kingston Crown Court heard. Choudhury said he was 'utterly ashamed and embarrassed. I degraded myself to a level I never thought I would go.' Last October four friends were planning to emmigrate to Syria 'to help people and give aid,' Choudhury said. He said he thought it was a 'noble thing' and eventually decided to join them. Choudhury said he 'just wanted to get away' and have a 'fresh start, a clean slate' and to 'start a new life.' 'That's why I wanted to go to Syria,' he said. 'To leave behind the lies and deceit and the debts.' Sentencing him at Kingston Crown Court (pictured) Judge Paul Dodgson said Choudhury had encouraged a large number of other young men to follow in his footsteps in joining ISIS but was 'living a lie' But in a series of Tweets on September 16 and 17, he wrote: 'Leaving wife & kids behind for Jihad feesabilillah [in the cause of Allah] becomes easy if the belief of Akhirah [hereafter] is sincerely accepted\\u2026All my life I strived to be something, someone, but isn't being a Muslim something, someone. 'Isn't being a Muslim the best thing ever?... The life of this world is nothing but a sweet poison that quenches the thirst of desire and drags the ungrateful soul deeper into Hell!' Choudhury's wife only found out about his lies when the trial opened. She gave evidence for the defence, saying: 'These messages, he's absolutely barmy, he's gone mad, he says things like this out of the blue, it's ridiculous, ridiculous...It p***es me off so much.' The judge said that Choudhury's wife, Toslima Akhtar, 34, 'would have a lot to forgive' but Hossein Zahir, defending, said the relationship was 'strained but maybe now on the mend.'

david bowie s first album in 10 years and a record that nobody outside his inner circle suspected was coming is a witty vandalization of the sleeve of 1977 s heroes as its designer jonathan barnbrook explains the heroes cover obscured by the white square is about the spirit of great pop or rock music which is of the moment forgetting or obliterating the past however we all know that this is never quite the case no matter how much we try we cannot break free from the past read more david bowie returns with new single album in that sense it s an unbeatable image bowie s glittering reputation rests on his determination during his extraordinary run of albums in the 1970s to escape the past and embrace the future but he was also clever enough to realize that there s no such thing as an entirely blank slate and that tension was the motor of his genius the excitement surrounding his surprise comeback after a decade of supposed retirement reminds us that he is rock s unrivalled innovator in chief his early reinventions could perhaps be explained by sheer ambition that s why david jones from suburban bromley on the southern outskirts of london became david bowie rhymes with zoe not maui and then bowie fearing that 1969 s space oddity would render him a one hit wonder became ziggy stardust the first post modern rock star if fame was all he was looking for he would have been happy with that but his hunger for change exceeded his appetite for success he killed off ziggy after just 18 months and unveiled a series of new identities each with its own sound photos david bowie s ever changing look to listen to all of bowie s 70s albums in sequence is still a dizzying experience because each one attempts to eclipse its predecessor on aladdin sane he explored the relationship between showbusiness and mental illness diamond dogs was an apocalyptic vision which spun the mid 70s darkest fears into a kind of glam rock opera the plastic soul of young americans was his strange response to the sound of black america and station to station recorded in cocaine maddened seclusion in los angeles in the guise of the thin white duke presaged his return to europe remarkably these page turning albums emerged at the rate of around one a year the only possible comparison in terms of creative momentum is the beatles and there were four of them beyond the records themselves bowie s restless eye for new stimuli drawn from the worlds of cinema theatre fashion and visual art made him pop s most imaginative stylist london s v a museum is mounting a major retrospective of his visual work this spring rare honor for a pop star read more bowie back after the bonds as the artwork of he next day and the lyrics of comeback single where are we now suggest bowie s mystique resides most powerfully in the three albums he recorded in berlin in the late 70s low heroes and lodger of all his rebirths this was the most radical influential and multi faceted the berlin albums are perfectly poised between art and pop containing both avant garde enigmas like warszawa and glorious gripping songs like the title track of heroes which sounded not at all out of place 35 years later as team gb s olympic anthem brian eno who worked on bowie s berlin trilogy once compared rock music to a blank sheet of paper that was rapidly filled in and bowie did more than anyone in the 70s to colonize that white space each record was to quote one song title a fantastic voyage alerting other musicians to new possibilities and charting a path for entire scenes it s impossible to imagine the landscape of early 80s pop for example without bowie s influence and you can detect his dna in countless artists from pet shop boys to lady gaga u2 to blur joy division to nine inch nails franz ferdinand to lcd soundsystem to any musician who worries about reconciling artistic integrity with commercial success or sonic innovation with emotional truth bowie s 70s work is proof that with enough talent and judgement you can have it all of course records this good cast a long shadow and to paraphrase barnbrook no matter how much he tried bowie couldn t break free from the past while his bad albums in subsequent decades were justly criticized his good ones were unfairly underrated although he remained curious enthusiastic and eager to take risks right up to 2003 s reality he was punished for no longer reinventing the wheel with each release as long as bowie was still recording regularly all but his most devoted fans took him for granted they won t be making

have returned after joining the brutal terror group all but one of those who stayed has since been killed in the fighting but choudhury was apparently sent back after failing the selection process sentencing him at kingston crown court judge paul dodgson said choudhury had encouraged a large number of other young men to follow in his footsteps speaking at kingston crown court in south west london the judge said whatever the motivation anybody who prepares to fight for a political or ideological cause in another country must be in no doubt that they commit a serious offence i have no doubt that when you embarked on this trip you and your companions hoped that your actions would encourage others to take the same journey that has indeed occurred with the disastrous consequences we and so many young men s families now live with the judge said that choudhury had been living a lie having cultivated an image of himself as a teacher or scholar and projected an image to the younger members of the group of being some sort of elder who could advise and guide them scroll down for video i believe in your imagination you saw yourself as some sort of leader and potential hero the judge said before adding that when choudhury got to the camp you were either deemed unsuitable or that when your fantasises collided with the harsh realities of the fighting in syria you lost the will to remain there the judge said that while choudhury was not the leader of the group there is no doubt in my mind that you as the older man encouraged them to remain committed to their plan and in due course you were even suggesting routes for them mashudur choudhury circled left pictured at gatwick airport before his journey to syria in october 2013 he said that choudhury even had an absurd plan to move his wife and two young children to syria but his wife thought it was barmy the muslim community in portsmouth blamed choudhury a father of two young children who ran a local youth group for

the money on prostitutes and foreign holidays he was found guilty in may of preparing acts of terrorism but there was a delay in sentencing pending a decision on another case from the court of appeal during the two week trial at kingston crown court jurors heard that choudhury travelled to syria pictured on october 8 last year with a group of younger men from their home town of portsmouth on

were killed in a us airstrike on kobane in october leaving only uzzaman alive it not believed any of them died fighting the forces of the assad regime choudhury lied to his family and told them he had cancer and then spent the money they gave him for treatment on holidays abroad and prostitutes choudhury had proposed calling the group the britani brigade bangladeshi bad boys until one of them

muslim youth project and worked as a racial awareness officer for the city council where he was asked to run part of the local prevent programme to counter violent extremism he lasted less than two years in the job and then gave it up to buy a caf near his local mosque in portsmouth borrowing 17 000 from his wife s sister but the business failed despite his financial difficulties choudhury bought a 17 000 audi a6 on hire purchase and made three trips to marrakesh in morocco with friends telling his wife he was on a business trip he set himself up as a life coach claiming he had trained and coached muslim and non muslim professionals on personal development and giving false examples of his work as part of the pretence he set up a company called unlimitedu success limited and wrote a blog explaining how islam had helped him overcome cancer he also used twitter to encourage young muslims to move to a muslim country and fight jihad his activity even involved setting up a false twitter account so that he could re tweet messages that backed his views alison morgan prosecuting said choudhury was leaving the shame of the life he had behind him to fight and become a martyr and make something of himself police were able to access choudary s twitter and whatsapp internet messages which exposed his wife s annoyance at his desire to go and fight abroad in one message his wife told him your treatment of me i just want to die i hate your attitude may you die i hate you you want to die in battlefield go die i really mean it just go i ll be relieved at last in may 2010 choudhury s wife who worked for portsmouth city council as a tenancy support officer came home from work to find him lying in bed she came upstairs and pulled the duvet off and i had been emotional at the time i had been crying at that time i don t know what came into my head but i told my wife i was diagnosed with cancer his wife s mother had died a few days earlier from cancer choudhury circled

said he had heard about a treatment in singapore and added i told my wife i wanted to go to singapore i just had a lot of pressure building up inside of me and i wanted to get away i felt a failure in regards to the business choudhury borrowed 8 000 from his wife s sister and another 27 000 from his own family and friends to pay for three trips to singapore texting back home with updates about fake operations in singapore he claimed he went to a hospital for an appointment but never returned for tests and spent most of his time in starbucks when he arrived back in britain he told his wife he had an internal operation one that wouldn t leave a scar he posed as a businessman called ali montana in singapore and spent hundreds of pounds seeking female company on his return to portsmouth he sent a series of explicit emails to an escort agency arranging sexual services kingston crown court heard choudhury said he was utterly ashamed and embarrassed i degraded myself to a level i never thought i would go last october four friends were planning to emmigrate to syria to help people and give aid choudhury said he said he thought it was a noble thing and eventually decided to join them choudhury said he just wanted to get away and have a fresh start a clean slate and to start a new life that s why i wanted to go to syria he said to leave behind the lies and deceit and the debts sentencing him at kingston crown court pictured judge paul dodgson said choudhury had encouraged a large number of other young men to follow in his footsteps in joining isis but was living a lie but in a series of tweets on september 16 and 17 he wrote leaving wife kids behind for jihad feesabilillah in the cause of allah becomes easy if the belief of akhirah hereafter is sincerely accepted all my life i strived to be something someone but isn t being a muslim something someone isn t being a muslim the best thing ever the life of this world is nothing but a sweet poison that quenches the thirst of desire and drags the ungrateful soul deeper into hell choudhury s wife only found out about his lies when the trial opened she gave evidence for the defence saying these messages he s absolutely barmy he s gone mad he says things like this out of the blue it s ridiculous ridiculous it p es me off so much the judge said that choudhury s wife toslima akhtar 34 would have a lot to forgive but hossein
